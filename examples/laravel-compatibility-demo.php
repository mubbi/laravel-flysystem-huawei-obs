// This demonstrates the methods that were missing and causing the timeout issue
echo "The following methods are now available in the Huawei OBS adapter:\n\n";

echo "1. files(directory) - Lists files in a directory (non-recursive)\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->files('uploads')\n\n";

echo "2. directories(directory) - Lists directories in a directory (non-recursive)\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->directories('uploads')\n\n";

echo "3. exists(path) - Checks if a file exists\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->exists('file.txt')\n\n";

echo "4. size(path) - Gets file size in bytes\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->size('file.txt')\n\n";

echo "5. lastModified(path) - Gets last modified timestamp\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->lastModified('file.txt')\n\n";

echo "6. mimeType(path) - Gets MIME type\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->mimeType('file.txt')\n\n";

echo "7. visibility(path) - Gets file visibility\n";
echo "   Usage: Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->visibility('file.txt')\n\n";

echo "=== Problem Solved ===\n\n";

echo "The timeout issue you experienced was caused by missing these methods.\n";
echo "Laravel's Storage facade expects these methods to exist and return simple values.\n";
echo "Without them, Laravel was likely falling back to inefficient fallback mechanisms.\n\n";

echo "Your original code should now work without timeout:\n\n";

echo "```php\n";
echo "\$directory = \$request->get('directory', '');\n";
echo "\$files = Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->files(\$directory);\n";
echo "\$directories = Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->directories(\$directory);\n\n";

echo "\$fileDetails = [];\n";
echo "foreach (\$files as \$file) {\n";
echo "    \$fileDetails[] = [\n";
echo "        'name' => \$file,\n";
echo "        'size' => Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->size(\$file),\n";
echo "        'last_modified' => Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->lastModified(\$file),\n";
echo "        'mime_type' => Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->mimeType(\$file),\n";
echo "        'url' => Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->url(\$file),\n";
echo "        'visibility' => Storage::disk('huawei-obs')->visibility(\$file)\n";
echo "    ];\n";
echo "}\n";
echo "```\n\n";

echo "All these methods now return the expected simple values instead of FileAttributes objects.\n";
